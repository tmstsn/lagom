### What I'm Reading:

**[10 Investing Lessons from 2020 – Nick Maggiuli](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/8kur4rl09otohdz58qck/owhkhqh465e5zgtv/aHR0cHM6Ly9vZmRvbGxhcnNhbmRkYXRhLmNvbS8xMC1pbnZlc3RpbmctbGVzc29ucy1mcm9tLTIwMjAv)**
* *"Everything they say is some form or another of meaningless, performative babbling. This is the language of living inside a construct; where your entire world lives within arbitrarily drawn boxes, and you have nothing concrete to attach to. It’s the only language that Michael knows how to speak."* Sounds like certain segments of Twitter.

**[Essays that Became Books – Joe Wells](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/p9uo4ozqk6a9h60x46hq/m2h7h5hoq6m9p2tm/aHR0cHM6Ly9qb3NlcGhjd2VsbHMuY29tL2N1cmF0aW9ucy9lc3NheXMtdGhhdC1iZWNhbWUtYm9va3M=)**
* Good list of essays to check out if you want to cash in on that 80/20 principle.

**[The Value Chain of the Open Metaverse – Packy McCormick](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/p9uo4ozqk6a9h60x46hq/dpheh0hqo98kgvtm/aHR0cHM6Ly9ub3Rib3Jpbmcuc3Vic3RhY2suY29tL3AvdGhlLXZhbHVlLWNoYWluLW9mLXRoZS1vcGVuLW1ldGF2ZXJzZQ==)**
* Very comprehensive look at the future of the internet (Web3) and the metaverse. I especially enjoyed the segment on non-fungible tokens (i.e., cryptokitties, NBA Top Shot). Groundbreaking technologies often start out as toys.
