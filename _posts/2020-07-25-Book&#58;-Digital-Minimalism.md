### What I'm Reading:

**[Talking Out Loud To Yourself Is A Technology For Thinking – Nana Ariel](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/mvud6drn4zb5h588dzbm/qvh8h7h8446oo8il/aHR0cHM6Ly9wc3ljaGUuY28vaWRlYXMvdGFsa2luZy1vdXQtbG91ZC10by15b3Vyc2VsZi1pcy1hLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktZm9yLXRoaW5raW5nP2NrX3N1YnNjcmliZXJfaWQ9MTExMTk1OTk1OVRhbGtpbmclMjBvdXQlMjBsb3VkJTIwdG8lMjB5b3Vyc2VsZiUyMGlzJTIwYSUyMHRlY2hub2xvZ3klMjBmb3IlMjB0aGlua2luZw==)**
* Speaking out loud to yourself "encourages the creation of developed, complex ideas." Everyone knows reading an essay out loud helps the editing process. But few recognize that reciting your thoughts out loud helps the idea-generation process, as well. "Just as ‘appetite comes with eating’, Kleist argues, ‘ideas come with speaking.'"

**[Forget New Year's Resolutions And Conduct A 'Past Year Review' Instead – Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/2018/12/28/past-year-review/)**
* Good exercise. Take a piece of paper and make two columns: "POSITIVE" and "NEGATIVE." Look at your calendar for the last year and write down the strongest positive and negative things that happened in their respective columns. Then, schedule more of those positive items in the new year. Make a plan to avoid the negative items.

**[Money and Happiness: Rank of Income, Not Income, Affects Life Satisfaction by Christopher J. Boyce, et al.](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/mvud6drn4zb5h588dzbm/9qhzhnhg662zzds9/aHR0cHM6Ly9qb3VybmFscy5zYWdlcHViLmNvbS9kb2kvZnVsbC8xMC4xMTc3LzA5NTY3OTc2MTAzNjI2NzE=)**
* Happiness has more to do with relative income than absolute income: "We found that the ranked position of an individual’s income predicts general life satisfaction, whereas absolute income and reference income have no effect." Thus, it would seem that increasing the income of all will not increase the happiness of all. Could this be an argument against universal basic income? At least a partial one?
