### Review

*The Wire* taught me a lot. I realized certain shows are mandatory viewing. I also became familiar with the writings of the great Alan Sepinwall, TV critic at Rolling Stone. His episode summaries for *The Wire* (and for *Better Call Saul*, which I recently caught up on) are fantastic and enlightening—a million times better than a Reddit episode thread. After finding Sepinwall on Twitter, I noticed that most of his serious writing (i.e., books) covered *The Sopranos*. With new shows stalled and professional sports at a trickle, what better time to embark on some mandatory viewing like *The Sopranos*?

The first season of The Sopranos is strange. It takes some adjustment. Viewers accustomed to perfectly-produced Netflix cupcakes and sweeping HBO fantasies (like me) might find the cinematography a little raw. I found this sentiment ends with the pilot, however, and I came to enjoy the stark, concrete palettes and occasionally goofy editing. It feels like New Jersey. It feels like 1999. And it reminds me of those fleeting glimpses of 90s HBO I caught in my parents’ bedroom as a kid.

The show’s first thirteen episodes do a fantastic job of introducing the Family, the themes, and the tricky, raunchy, dark dynamics of mob life. It’s also much funnier than I expected. The dialogue is zingy and almost lyrically Italian. The show can also be incredibly tense and violent. Overall, the first season feels like an appropriately rough and rich introduction to an all-time show. Standing alone, however, it falls a bit short of that top tier of television.

### Quick Thoughts
•	I like Christopher as a character. He’s like a slightly more competent Ziggy from *The Wire* season two. He gives the viewer a better understanding of mob life in the lower ranks. He's ambitious but totally insecure, and it's fun to watch. That said, the episode where he and his girlfriend try to break into the music business is by far the worst of the season.

•	Father Phil is an absolute gem. The premise of his character is so weird, but so genius. A flirtatious but pious *schnorrer* who preys on despondent mob wives—he's a mad lib in a clerical collar. I hope Carmela didn’t run him off with her frank psychoanalysis. 

•	Are we supposed to dislike Tony at any point in this show? Season One has Tony doing some horrible things, but I never stopped liking him (or really even questioning him) for a second. He's Homer Simpson, who just happens to carry piano wire on him in case he spots a rat on his daughter's college trip. 

•	The therapist scenes are a perfect checkpoint. The show often leaves things blurry, like Livia's motives or Pussy's disappearance. Then the dynamite Dr. Melfi gives some perspective. The therapy framework (and the ducks motif) reminded me of "Catcher in the Rye," and I think a lot could be said about Tony's similarities to Holden Caulfield. Both are flawed, irreverent protagonists trying to carve out a decent existence for their loved ones in a world they've convinced themselves is bullshit.
