## In the author's own words:

> One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare. If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results. Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship.

## Why I liked/disliked this book:

The thesis is sound: your ability to focus and eliminate distractions will catapult your productivity and separate you from your peers. Most people recognize that technology has outpaced evolution, and we know that our devices prey on our brain’s desire for distraction. This book examines what we can do about it.

The most convincing ideas sound like things you’ve already thought but haven’t put words to, and Deep Work is full of these insights. I really enjoy the notion that our ability to focus is a muscle that we’re training at all hours of the day—not just working hours. In other words, if I idly open Twitter when a television commercial comes on, I’m training my brain to find distraction whenever the slightest inconvenience arises. It doesn’t matter that I’m already relaxing by watching television. Neurons that fire together wire together.

Speckled throughout the book are profiles of deep work practitioners and their unique styles. I like that Newport draws from a wide range of source material, from McKinsey reports to New York Times articles to personal interviews. By doing so, he steps out of the “academic” or “scholar” box and writes more as a cultural critic. It works. My one criticism of the book is that the first part, which is essentially a sales pitch for deep work, is too long.

## What I took away:

•	Newport puts forward strong arguments for radically scaling back social media use, which I’ve since implemented. My two biggest digital vices are Instagram and Reddit. Per Newport’s advice, I’ve allotted time in the morning and evening for these sites—“Don’t take breaks from distraction. Instead take breaks from focus.” I’ve also deleted (almost) all social media apps from my phone. My screen time has decreased substantially.

•	Another positive takeaway has been my use of Instapaper. Instapaper allows you to maintain a reading list of articles and webpages, which you can access later, take notes on, and save to your own folders. Too often I would poke around on the news sites without fully reading anything, faintly aware I was procrastinating. Now if I see an interesting article, I save it to Instapaper and read it later with care and attention. 

•	Newport also discussed “productive meditation,” where you set parameters for something to think about, then take a walk and think critically. If your mind wanders, refocus your attention to the problem. Just like your breath in meditation. I tried it a couple times with middling success. I think my problems weren’t complicated enough. My solution or plan came to me within the first hundred steps, and I spent the rest of the walk just looping my thoughts over and over.

Apart from that, the book makes a strong argument for crafting your days carefully and ahead of time. That’s a constant practice and one I’ll continue to work on.
