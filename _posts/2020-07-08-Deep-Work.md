## In the author's own words:

> One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare. If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results. Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship.

## Why I liked/disliked this book:

The thesis is sound: your ability to focus and eliminate distractions can catapult your productivity and separate you from your peers. Most people recognize that technology has outpaced evolution, and our devices prey on our brains' desire for distraction. This book examines what we can do about it.

*Deep Work* is full of that wonderful type of idea that sounds like something you already knew but hadn't put words to. Take, for example, Newport's notion that your ability to focus is a muscle that you're training at all hours of the day—not just working hours. In other words, if you idly open Twitter when a television commercial comes on, you're training your brain to seek distraction whenever the slightest inconvenience arises. It doesn’t matter that you're already relaxing by watching television. Neurons that fire together wire together.

Speckled throughout the book are profiles of deep work practitioners and their unique styles. Newport draws from a wide range of source material, from McKinsey reports to New York Times articles to personal interviews. By doing so, he steps out of the “academic” box and writes more as a cultural critic. Some may prefer a more careful review of evidence (à la *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahnemahn), but Newport's more anecdotal style works, too. 

The first part of the book functions as a sales pitch for deep work and runs far too long. Also, the advice regarding email seems much more appropriate for executive types than young professionals.

## What I took away:

* Newport puts forward a strong argument for quitting social media. My two biggest digital vices are Instagram and Reddit. Per Newport’s advice, I’ve allotted time in the morning and evening for these sites—“Don’t take breaks from distraction. Instead take breaks from focus.” I’ve also deleted (almost) all social media apps from my phone. My screen time has decreased substantially.

* Another positive takeaway has been my use of [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/). Instapaper allows you to maintain a reading list of articles and webpages, which you can access later, take notes on, and save to your own folders. Too often I would poke around on news sites without fully reading anything, faintly aware I was procrastinating. Now if I see an interesting article, I save it to Instapaper and read it later with care and attention.

* Newport also discussed “productive meditation,” where you set parameters for a problem to think about, then take a walk and think attentively. If your mind wanders, refocus your attention to the problem—just like your breath in meditation. I tried it a couple times with middling success.

Apart from that, the book highlights the paramount importance of crafting your days carefully and ahead of time. That’s a constant practice and one I’ll continue to work on.
