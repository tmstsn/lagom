### What I'm Reading:

**[Just Take the Money – Nick Maggiuli](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduz7zpovkh7hwndv8tl/l2hehmhono70wva6/aHR0cHM6Ly9vZmRvbGxhcnNhbmRkYXRhLmNvbS9qdXN0LXRha2UtdGhlLW1vbmV5Lw==)**
* What should a 39 year old whose net worth is $12 million in Tesla stock do? How about a 67 year old whose net worth is $1.8 million in GE stock? As this article carefully illustrates, they should obviously sell and diversify. But for these two individuals, their identities are too entwined with their investments. Better to untangle the two.

**[The Rise Of The Full-Stack Freelancer – Tiago Forte](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduz7zpovkh7hwndv8tl/m2h7h5hoqozgw7bm/aHR0cHM6Ly9mb3J0ZWxhYnMuY28vYmxvZy90aGUtcmlzZS1vZi10aGUtZnVsbC1zdGFjay1mcmVlbGFuY2VyLw==)**
* Why we should think about having a portfolio of income, not just investments.

**[Coolest Things I Learned In 2020 – David Perell](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduz7zpovkh7hwndv8tl/7qh7h8h0605k3oiz/aHR0cHM6Ly9wZXJlbGwuY29tL2Vzc2F5L2Nvb2xlc3QtdGhpbmdzLWktbGVhcm5lZC1pbi0yMDIwLw==)**
* My favorite was his blurb on lighting a room. As one architect pointed out, "If you build a room with light on one side only, you can be almost certain that you are wasting your money. People will stay out of that room if they can possibly avoid it.”
* (If you don’t have windows from two sides, you can replicate the effect by hanging a mirror on the wall opposite of where the sun shines.) Here's a room I want to be in:

### Quote of the Week:
> "We must be very suspicious of the deceptions of the element of time. It takes a good deal of time to eat or to sleep, or to earn a hundred dollars, and a very little time to entertain a hope and an insight which becomes the light of our life." 

–Ralph Waldo Emerson


### Word of the Week:

**anagnorisis** (n) (an-ag-NOR-ih-sis):

The point in a play, novel, etc., in which a principal character recognizes or discovers another character's true identity or the true nature of their own circumstances.

"The hallmark of Scooby Doo is the moment of anagnorisis when we finally get to see who is under the monster's mask."
